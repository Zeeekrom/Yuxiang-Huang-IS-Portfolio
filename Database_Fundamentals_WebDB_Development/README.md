# 💾 Database Fundamentals + Web Database Development

**Type:** Coursework Projects (Exchange Program – Saint Martin’s University, USA)  
**Timeline:** Spring 2025  
**Courses:** Database Fundamentals · Web Database Development  
**Role:** System Designer & Full-Stack Collaborator  

---

## 🎯 Overview

These two consecutive courses formed a continuous learning journey from **information structure** to **functional system**.  
The first course, *Database Fundamentals*, focused on building solid theoretical foundations — relational modeling, normalization, ER design, and SQL optimization.  
The second, *Web Database Development*, extended those concepts into a real-world full-stack project: a **peer-learning platform** that matches students based on subject strengths and meeting availability.

Together, they helped me connect **information semantics → data models → operational systems**, showing how well-designed data architecture supports meaningful human interaction.

## 🧩 Course 1 – Database Fundamentals

### 🧠 Core Learning

- **Relational Model & Normalization:** Applied 1NF → 3NF and key/foreign-key dependency analysis to ensure data consistency.  
- **ER Modeling:** Designed entity–relationship diagrams for a *Library Management System* (entities: books, readers, loans).  
- **SQL Practice:** Built and queried multiple relational tables using joins, grouping, and aggregate functions.  
- **Constraints & Query Reuse:** Focused on maintainable integrity constraints and reusable query patterns.

### 📊 Sample Schema

| **Entity** | **Example Fields**                                      | **Description**                                 |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Book**   | ISBN, Title, Author, Genre, Publish_Date, Availability  | Defines library inventory and borrowable status |
| **Reader** | Reader_ID, Name, Membership_Date, Email                 | Represents library users                        |
| **Loan**   | Loan_ID, ISBN, Reader_ID, Borrow_Date, Return_Date, Fee | Tracks borrowing history and overdue fees       |

Implemented **multi-table joins** and **aggregate queries** to calculate usage rate, late-fee summaries, and available inventory.

## 🧩 Course 2 – Web Database Development

### 🌐 Project: “Campus Study Match” Platform

A prototype academic peer-support system where students register their subject strengths, desired help areas, and available meeting slots.  
The system automatically matches compatible users and suggests on-campus meeting locations.

### 🔧 Implementation Highlights

**Database Design (MySQL):**  
- Core tables: Student, Skill, Match, Location.  
- Enforced foreign keys and referential integrity to maintain data consistency.  

**Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**  
- Responsive interface for registration and profile editing.  

**Backend (PHP):**  
- Implemented form validation, CRUD operations, and matching logic.  

**Workflow:**  
- Followed structured milestones — *Requirements → Design → Build → Test → Integration.*

---

## 🧩 My Role

- Designed full **ER model** and **relational schema**, ensuring scalable and normalized structure.  
- Defined **form validation logic** and **data flow** between front- and back-end layers.  
- Coordinated **integration milestones** with teammates; delivered **system presentation and testing report**.  
- Emphasized **data usability**, **accessibility**, and **governance** throughout development.

---

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- **Bridged theory and application:** From abstract data rules to a working, user-centered system.  
- **Strengthened data governance mindset:** Realized that good systems begin with consistent semantics and data lineage.  
- **Enhanced collaboration:** Practiced documentation, milestone planning, and version control in a small agile team.  
- **Shifted perspective:** From “writing SQL” to “designing sustainable information products.”  

> “Database design is not about storing data — it’s about giving meaning to how information lives and connects.”
