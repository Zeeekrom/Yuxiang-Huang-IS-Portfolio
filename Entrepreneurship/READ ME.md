# 🚀 AR Metaverse Content Platform – Entrepreneurship Project

**Type:** Entrepreneurial Venture (Seed Stage)  
**Timeline:** Nov 2024 – Jan 2025  
**Role:** Co-Founder & AIGC Technical / Recruitment Lead  

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **AR Metaverse Content Platform** was a short-term startup initiative exploring how **AR interaction**, **spatial mapping**, and **generative 3D environments** could be combined into a repeatable business model for public entertainment and education.  
We envisioned an open, low-cost framework that allows shopping malls, schools, and cultural venues to deploy immersive AR missions using AI-generated content — without needing full-time developers or designers.

The project connected three domains I care deeply about — **user experience design**, **data governance**, and **creative system management** — proving that immersive entertainment can be operated as a **structured information system**.

## 🧩 Objectives

- Prototype a cross-platform AR experience integrating **multiplayer gameplay**, **spatial anchors**, and **AI-generated 3D scenes**.  
- Develop a **B2B commercialization model** for malls and theme parks, with measurable engagement and reporting metrics.  
- Build a **governed content workflow** to track assets, version history, and license boundaries.  
- Design a **data-informed recruitment process** for early-stage team expansion.

## 💼 My Role & Contributions

- **AR Interaction Design** – Led the prototyping of real-time multiplayer experiences and spatial anchor management for dynamic on-site play.  
- **AIGC Integration** – Directed design of generative 3D environment pipeline (LoRA + ComfyUI) ensuring consistency, licensing, and reproducibility.  
- **Commercial Planning** – Structured a subscription-based B2B model for venue partnerships; pitched to investors and secured initial mentorship interest.  
- **Recruitment & Workflow** – Designed data-driven hiring workflows, candidate evaluations, and performance dashboards for small cross-functional teams.  
- **Information Management** – Defined metadata templates, content versioning rules, and model cards for creative asset traceability.

## 💡 Insights

Running this startup taught me how **information structure determines operational scalability**.  
Managing creative assets, team data, and partner deliverables under defined schemas made our work faster, traceable, and auditable — even in a creative domain.

It also strengthened my belief that **information management is the backbone of every scalable idea**, whether in education, entertainment, or enterprise.

> “A creative system only scales when its data — not its people — carries the consistency.”
