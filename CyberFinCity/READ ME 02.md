# 🌐 Cyber FinCity – Web3 Financial Education Metaverse  

**Type:** Innovation & Research Project  
**Timeline:** 2024 – 2025  
**Tech Stack:** Unreal Engine 5 · Unity · Python · ComfyUI · Stable Diffusion · LoRA · VR/AR Toolkit  

---

## 🎯 Overview  

**Cyber FinCity** is a prototype metaverse that transforms **financial literacy education** into an immersive, data-driven experience.  
Set in a **digital twin of Shanghai & Shenzhen (2035)**, it integrates **Web3, VR, and AIGC** technologies to create a **gamified learning world** where users complete interactive missions on budgeting, risk, and anti-fraud awareness.  

> The project demonstrates how *information-management* and *data-governance* principles can support scalable content creation, adaptive learning, and measurable educational outcomes.

---

## 🧩 Objectives  

- Design an interactive financial-education platform linking gameplay with learning analytics.  
- Build an **AIGC asset pipeline** ensuring visual consistency and metadata traceability.  
- Implement **version control + asset lineage** for cross-functional collaboration.  
- Develop **mission-flow and assessment systems** tied to real user-behavior data.  
- Establish a **minimum viable information-management framework** for permissions, workflow, and updates.

## 💼 My Role & Contributions  

| Area | Contributions |
|:--|:--|
| **Instructional & Gamification Design** | Mapped financial concepts (Budget, Interest, Risk, Anti-fraud) into mission chains and scoring logic. |
| **Scene Prototyping** | Built UE/Unity demos with interactive assets, branching dialogue, and real-time feedback. |
| **AIGC Pipeline** | Standardized naming, tagging, and version rules for SD/LoRA assets; automated batch generation & QC. |
| **Metadata Governance** | Implemented lineage tracking (who / what / when) and revision logs for rollback and audits. |
| **Team Management** | Planned sprints, deliverables, and Kanban tracking to release a new demo every two weeks. |

## 🧠 Information-Management Framework  

| Domain | Key Design | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Access & Permissions | RBAC / ABAC roles (student, teacher, admin, auditor) | Fine-grained authorization & action auditing |
| Content Model & Metadata | Unified schema for course, task, question, asset | Searchable, reusable, measurable content |
| Lifecycle Workflow | Create → Review → Publish → Deprecate → Archive | Enforce accountability & traceability |
| Version & Source Control | Record author, version, reason, license | Enable rollback & multi-user sync |
| Event Dictionary | Standard names for “enter / stay / exit / accuracy” | Comparable analytics across classes |
| Data Quality Rules | Missing-value & drift thresholds + alerts | Keep dashboards & reports trustworthy |
| Privacy & Compliance | Minimal collection, anonymization, retention policy | Meet school & local regulations |
| Observability Dashboard | Teacher vs Operations views | Track learning progress & system health |

## 🖼️ AIGC Asset Pipeline Optimization  

| Pain Point | Solution | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Style inconsistency | Created style-guide boards + prompt templates | Unified visuals → -30% review time |
| Incomplete requests | Standardized asset request form | Reduced rework loops |
| Traceability gaps | Added metadata cards (base model, weights, ControlNet) | Full asset lineage |
| Format conflicts | Pre-import scripts for Unity/UE (color space, LOD) | Stable imports |
| License risks | License tags + expiry fields | Ensured compliance |

## 🏗️ Essential Information-Management Modules for Scaling Up  

| Module | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| Identity & Access Control | Role/attribute-based authorization & audit trail (“who did what when”). |
| Unified Content Schema | Consistent fields (tags, version, license) for search and reuse. |
| Workflow & Lifecycle Control | Prevents gray publishing and enables rollback/version diff. |
| Version & Source Governance | Records change author and reason → supports compliance & team sync. |
| Data Dictionary & Event Model | Standardizes user events for cross-semester comparison. |
| Search & Navigation | Indexed lookup & faceted filters for teachers/students. |
| Data Quality & Alerting | Detects missing or drifting data to ensure report accuracy. |
| Privacy & Compliance | Defines data scope · retention · anonymization policies. |
| Release & Rollback Strategy | Gradual rollout by school/class + auto revert for stability. |
| Observability & Dashboards | Dual views for learning and system operations. |
| Integration & Interoperability | API / SSO / LMS connectors for standardized exchange. |
| Localization & Accessibility | Multi-language & a11y support for inclusive learning. |
| Backup & Knowledge Base | Runbooks, FAQs, case library for training and incident recovery. |

## 💡 Insights  

By managing courses, user behavior, and AI-generated content under unified schemas and governance,  
I learned how **information management turns creativity into measurable value**.  

> The system’s dual nature — educational platform + data platform — proved that innovation and compliance can coexist through transparent structure.  

**“A sustainable digital platform is not just creative; it is governed, traceable, and continually improvable.”**
