# 🎮 Game_Design – Interactive Game Concept & System Design Project

**Type:** Concept / Prototype  
**Timeline:** 2024  
**Role:** Lead Game Designer & Information Systems Architect  

---

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a **game design prototype** created to explore how **player choice**, **system feedback**, and **information flow** can drive meaningful engagement.  
The concept centers around a dynamic **city simulation** where players manage **resource flows**, **citizen behaviors**, and **emergent events**, while the underlying system logs and processes these into **visible feedback loops**.

In line with my academic focus on **Information Systems and Management**, the project emphasizes how **design systems** can function as **information ecosystems**, not just entertainment.

## 🧩 Design Goals

- Define a **core game loop** that reflects real-world resource management and decision consequences (e.g., “build → monitor → respond to citizen event → optimize”).  
- Build a **feedback system** where player actions generate data that influence game state and visible metrics (satisfaction, resource balance, risk).  
- Design a **modular architecture** for events and behaviors so new content can be added without rewriting major code — reflecting system scalability and governance.  
- Integrate **analytics & transparency**: players can open a *City Dashboard* to view event logs, resource trends, and citizen feedback, mirroring enterprise dashboards in information management.

## 💼 My Role & Contributions

- **Information Flow Design:** Mapped how player actions translate into system states and feedback loops.  
- **Event-Model Schema:** Defined event types (*Service Request*, *Infrastructure Breakdown*, *Public Protest*), their triggers, outcomes, and impact on city metrics.  
- **Dashboard Prototype:** Created visual mock-ups for monitoring resource usage, satisfaction, and event frequency, showing how system design supports decision-making.  
- **Information Governance:** Defined metadata and logging standards for in-game events to ensure traceability and visualization accuracy.  
- **Documentation:** Produced a concise **mini-GDD (Game Design Document)** focused on mechanics, data schemas, and player workflows rather than art or engine details.

## 🧠 Why It Demonstrates My Application Focus

- **Information Systems Thinking:** The game was designed as a network of interconnected data flows, mirroring enterprise information management structures.  
- **Governance & Scalability:** Modular event schemas and metadata standards turned creative design into a repeatable, governable framework.  
- **Decision Support & Transparency:** The *City Dashboard* represents an in-game decision-support system—paralleling business intelligence dashboards.  
- **Cross-functional Design:** Bridged mechanics, UI, data modeling, and player psychology—illustrating the intersection between game design and information management.
