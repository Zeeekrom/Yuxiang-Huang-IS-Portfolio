🎮 Game_Design – Interactive Game Concept & System Design Project

Type: Concept / Prototype
Timeline: 2024
Role: Lead Game Designer & Information Systems Architect

🎯 Overview

This project is a game design prototype I created to explore how player choice, system feedback, and information flow can drive meaningful engagement. The game concept centers around a dynamic “city simulation” where players manage resource flows, citizen behaviors, and emergent events, and the underlying system logs and processes these into visible feedback loops.
In line with my application focus on information systems and management, the project emphasizes how design systems can function as information ecosystems, not just entertainment.

🧩 Design Goals

Define a core game loop that reflects real-world resource management and decision consequences (e.g., “build → monitor → respond to citizen event → optimize”).

Build a feedback system where player actions generate data, which then influences game state and visible metrics (satisfaction, resource balance, risk).

Design a modular architecture for events and behaviours so new events can be added without rewriting major code – reflecting my interest in system scalability and governance.

Integrate analytics & transparency: players can open “City Dashboard” to see event logs, resource trends, citizens’ complaints, enabling them to adjust strategy—this mirrors enterprise dashboards in information management.

💼 My Role & Contributions

Led the concept and design of the game’s information flow model, mapping how player actions translate into system states and feedback.

Developed the event-model schema, defining event types (e.g., “Service Request”, “Infrastructure Breakdown”, “Public Protest”), their triggers, outcomes, and impact on city metrics.

Created a dashboard prototype (visual mock-up) for monitoring resource usage, citizen satisfaction, and event frequency, which exposed how system design supports player decision making.

Defined metadata and logging standards for in-game events to ensure data could be aggregated, audited and visualised—applying information governance principles in a game context.

Documented the game design process in a “mini-GDD” (Game Design Document) focusing less on art/engine and more on mechanics, information schemas and player workflows.

🧠 Why It Demonstrates My Application Focus

Information Systems Thinking: The game was designed as a system of interconnected data flows, not just mechanics—mirroring how businesses manage information assets.

Governance & Scalability: By designing modular event schemas and metadata standards, I translated creative design into a repeatable, governable structure.

Decision Support & Transparency: The dashboard concept shows how players (or stakeholders) can make informed decisions based on underlying data—a parallel to business intelligence and analytics in my field of study.

Cross-functional Design: The project required thinking about mechanics, UI, data modelling, and player psychology—bridging game design and information management disciplines.
