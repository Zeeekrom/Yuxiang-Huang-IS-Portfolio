## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was completed as the final deliverable for **CSC 320 – IT Project Management** during my exchange semester at **Saint Martin’s University**.  
It represents a comprehensive **Project Management Plan (PMP)** for *AFK Arena 2*, a large-scale mobile RPG simulation designed to explore how information systems, financial analysis, and structured management interact in real production environments.

Building on my internship experience at **Tencent** and **Lilith**, where I learned about data-driven coordination and cross-departmental workflows, I focused this PMP on transforming abstract management theories into a **data-centric decision system**.  
The plan integrates **PMBOK** principles with **Agile iteration**, balancing flexibility and control while maintaining measurable performance indicators through **Earned Value Management (EVM)**.

## 🧩 Objectives and Results

- Developed a complete PMP covering seven knowledge areas: **scope**, **schedule**, **cost**, **quality**, **HR**, **communication**, and **risk**.  
- Conducted a **Business Case Analysis (BCA)** demonstrating project feasibility — **NPV ≈ $136M**, **ROI ≈ 132.79%**, **payback ≈ 2 years**.  
- Constructed a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, **Network Diagram**, and **Gantt Chart** to visualize dependencies, milestones, and deliverables.  
- Applied **EVM metrics (CPI/SPI)** to evaluate cost-schedule performance and identify early-stage variance trends.  
- Designed **Agile sprint cycles** and milestone checkpoints to enable iterative delivery, quality feedback, and dynamic re-planning.  
- Defined **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for post-UAT bug rate (< 0.5%) and team communication efficiency (+15%).

## 💼 My Role and Responsibilities

As the **Project Manager**, I acted as both planner and data integrator:  

- Built the full PMP document, ensuring consistency across sub-plans and measurable metrics.  
- Defined the project scope and mapped stakeholder requirements using the **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**.  
- Created the cost baseline and resource allocation plan based on **BCA outputs**.  
- Designed and updated the **Gantt Chart**, monitoring real-time variance through **EVM**.  
- Performed **risk assessment** using a **Probability–Impact Matrix** and developed mitigation strategies.  
- Formulated the **communication plan** and **RACI Matrix** to coordinate cross-functional departments.  

Through this process, I learned to treat a **PMP not merely as documentation**, but as an **information system** that collects, processes, and communicates data for organizational decision-making.

## 💡 Insights and Reflections

This project marked a turning point in how I perceive management: rather than a checklist process, it is an **information architecture problem**.  
Every plan — from **WBS** to **EVM report** — functions as a **data interface** that connects strategy and execution.

By synthesizing **Agile iteration** with **PMBOK control**, I learned to balance **human coordination** with **digital traceability**, which later influenced how I structured internal management tools during my **Tencent internship**.
