💼 Internships — From Creative Work to Information Systems

This section documents real workflow experiences from three internships:
Tencent IEG (Honor of Kings), Lilith Games (AIGC Pipeline), and Perfect World (AI Environment Art).
All information is depersonalized; only the systems, documentation structure, and information-management practices are retained.

🧩 Most Complex Information Flow — Tencent IEG (Honor of Kings)
Systems and Documents Accessed Daily
1) Data & Telemetry (supporting win/pick/telemetry analysis)

Internal BI Dashboards: segmented win rates, pick-ban data, match duration, KDA, damage share, usage heat (P0/P1…King tier; 7/14/30-day windows).

Data Warehouse / SQL:

Example tables: hero_metrics_daily, match_skill_events (skill cast / hit / kill / control frames), economy_timeline (gold & XP curves), ab_result_summary (A/B aggregates).

Logs & Replays: combat logs (killfeed, damage_tick, ability_cast), client/server replay tools for verifying mechanic triggers.

2) Experiment & Parameter Configuration (for balance iteration)

Experiment / Gray-release platform: create and monitor skill parameter tests (damage, cooldown, mana cost, hitbox size, effect threshold); track sample size, significance, stop-rules.

Configuration center / parameter sheets: hero growth curves, skill frame data, equipment / rune / buff coefficients; hotfix switches and rollback conditions.

3) Design & Version Management

Design doc library: hero design intent, frame data, collision & hit rules, meeting notes.

Iteration boards (TAPD / Jira): numerical change tasks, validation lists, defect reports, milestones, release changelogs.

4) QA & Quality Monitoring

Test-case library: edge-case combos, frame validation, abnormal state overlaps (silence / knock-up / vulnerability stacks).

Performance dashboards: crash rate, frame drop, skill chain latency; alert logs and regression results.

5) Operations & External Feedback

Tournament / high-rank reports: comparing pro-match samples vs ladder play.

Community / support tag reports: frequent complaints or misunderstandings, to separate “experience issues” from “numerical strength.”

6) Daily Stakeholders to Sync With

Numerical & gameplay designers, client/server engineers, data analysts, QA testers, operations & esports teams.

Typical Multi-System Scenarios
(1) Gray-Release for Hero Parameter Tuning

Data viewed: segmented win/pick rates, match duration, economy curves, A/B significance & sample size.

Tools used: BI dashboard + SQL + experiment platform + configuration center.

Alignment: design, client/server, analytics, QA, operations.

Outputs: modification notes, test cases, gray-release plan (scope, thresholds, stop rules), rollback config, changelog.

(2) Skill-Mechanic Anomaly Investigation

Data viewed: event timestamps, abnormal logs, outlier KDA / damage peaks.

Tools: combat logs & replay tools, TAPD/Jira tickets, frame tables, collision-rule docs.

Alignment: gameplay, animation/physics, backend logic, QA.

Outputs: reproduction videos, frame-table fixes, prioritized defect list, regression checklist.

(3) Community or Esports “Overpowered” Review

Data viewed: pro vs public win-rate gap, lane-time & economy lead curves, counter matrix.

Tools: sentiment reports, BI comparison boards, layered SQL queries, A/B platform.

Outputs: categorized conclusions (experience / perception / numeric), communication brief, micro-adjustment plan & release window.

(4) Pre-Release “Regression + Rollback” Audit

Data viewed: gray-release curves, crash/freeze rate, KPI thresholds.

Tools: monitoring dashboards, rollback scripts, test-coverage reports.

Alignment: client/server leads, QA, Ops/Publishing.

Outputs: rollout plan, alert thresholds, rollback ownership, final release checklist.

🧩 AIGC Content-Pipeline Pain Points and Solutions
Problem	Manifestation	My Handling	Further Optimization
Too many asset/model versions; unclear lineage	Multiple LoRA / Prompt / ControlNet versions per style; final package untraceable.	Created minimal “Model/Prompt Cards” recording base model, weight, sampler, CFG, ControlNet type; wrote who/when/which_model/which_prompt metadata before commit.	Add model registry & hash validation.
Style inconsistency; heavy manual curation	Cross-level lighting & angle drift, different prompt habits.	Built golden reference board (10–20 key images), preset templates (ComfyUI/SD params + negative list); dual-channel review (subjective + similarity).	Add style classifier / embedding alignment for semi-auto filtering.
Incomplete requests; repeated clarification	Missing usage/resolution/deadline/license info.	Enforced request template (use case, res/aspect, refs, must/optional elements, license window); no ticket → no schedule.	Integrate mandatory template into request system.
Format mismatch before Unity/UE import	Different export size/color space/bit depth.	Co-wrote batch preprocessing script (rename, unify size/color space/LOD) with TA; must pass local self-check before merge.	CI hook for auto validation.
Unclear license boundaries	Ambiguous third-party rights & expiry.	Added license tags & expiry fields; built sample registry (source, agreement, limitations) + weekly reminder.	Connect to legal contract database.
Invisible efficiency	Team tracked quantity but not conversion.	Built lightweight dashboard showing generation → usable → packaged; annotated rejection causes.	Auto-link dashboard to asset DB.
GPU resource contention	LoRA training and batch inference overlapped.	Created resource booking & priority pools; made low-VRAM presets for previews.	Implement job-queue manager & budget alerts.
🧩 Methods to Improve Discoverability and Collaboration

Naming & Tagging Convention (Minimal Viable Rule)

[Project_AssetType_Style_Res_Version_Date_Author]


Unified tags:
style:filmic | lora:v3.2 | cn:openpose | res:2048x1024 | color:sRGB | lic:comm-ok
→ Immediate clarity on usage, style, version, license; supports fuzzy search & batch ops.

Asset Metadata Cards (Model/Prompt Cards)
Fields: base_model, lora_id, lora_alpha, ckpt_hash, sampler, steps, cfg, controlnet(type,strength), seed_range, author, date.
→ One card per model/prompt version; stored with asset for easy rollback and traceability.

Request Templates (Single-Source Alignment)
Mandatory fields: purpose, resolution/ratio, style ref, mutable/fixed elements, release window, license limits.
→ No template, no scheduling; missing fields fixed in weekly sync.

Directory & Index Convention

/Project/AssetType(Character/Env/FX)/StylePack/Version/BatchID/


asset_index.csv (asset_id, path, tags, lic, version, source, status)
→ Faster cross-user search; clear in-package status.

Pre-Import Batch Scripts (UE/Unity)
Auto-unify naming, size, color space, bit depth; generate thumbnails & LOD presets; export fail list.
Must run before commit; CI re-checks before merge.

Version & Lineage Table (Lightweight Traceability)

final_asset_id ← batch_id ← model_version ← prompt_version ← controlnet_cfg


→ One-page lineage map for rollback & reproduction.

“Golden Style” Baseline Boards
10–20 benchmark images per character/theme with evaluation criteria (composition, lighting ratio, material, tone).
Used for both training reference and review scoring.

Reusable Preset Library (ComfyUI/SD)
Common resolution, lighting, camera, material setups; negative-prompt blacklist; scene templates.
→ Newcomers productive immediately; veterans maintain consistency.

Lightweight Efficiency Dashboard
Metrics: generation → usable → packaged; rejection reasons (style, resolution, license, import fail); avg processing time.
→ Weekly summaries visualize bottlenecks & guide iteration.

Mini Glossary of Terms
Examples:
style:filmic = “realistic-film look”;
lic:comm-ok = “commercial use allowed”;
lock:hair_color = “non-modifiable element.”
→ Ensures shared vocabulary across art / 3D / TA / design / legal.

Document Templates & Definition of Done (DoD)
Standard bundle: style guide, parameter log, import checklist, review notes, rollback plan.
→ Must pass all checks before asset submission.

Permission Zones
Asset library divided into production / review / release areas; release zone read-only.
→ Prevents accidental overwrite or deletion.

🌐 Takeaway

Through these internships I wasn’t just “creating content.”
I saw how large studios manage data, versioning, and cross-department alignment—
from BI dashboards and A/B tests to LoRA registries and asset metadata cards.

Each process answered the same question:
How can information stay clear, trustworthy, and reusable?

“What began as gameplay or art production became a study of data governance —
every table, tag, and template is a small act of keeping chaos in check.”
