📊 Intro to Statistics Project – Automotive Data Analysis

Type: Academic Coursework Project
Course: Introduction to Statistics
Institution: Saint Martin’s University, USA
Timeline: Spring 2025
Role: Lead Analyst & Documentation Coordinator

🎯 Overview

This project applies descriptive and inferential statistical methods to analyze relationships within the Cars dataset.
Working as a mock analytics team for an automotive industry magazine, our objective was to provide data-driven insights about car performance and pricing trends using real-world datasets.

The project covers three major statistical questions:

Is there a difference in mean horsepower between US and non-US midsize cars?

Is car type associated with price category?

Is there a relationship between horsepower and price among expensive cars?

🧩 Methods & Techniques

Descriptive Analysis: mean, standard deviation, quartiles, fences, box plots.

Inferential Analysis:

Two-sample t-test (Welch) for comparing means.

Chi-square test for association between categorical variables.

Simple linear regression for modeling horsepower–price relationship.

Tools Used: Excel statistical functions, charts, and built-in analysis add-ins.

Significance Level: α = 0.05; both classical and p-value approaches applied.

📈 Key Findings
Question	Method	Main Finding
1. Mean Horsepower (US vs. Non-US)	Two-Sample t-Test	Non-US midsize cars have slightly higher mean horsepower, but the difference is not statistically significant.
2. Car Type vs. Price Category	Chi-Square Test	No significant association found — price level is not strongly dependent on car type alone.
3. Horsepower vs. Price	Linear Regression	Positive and significant relationship (p < 0.05, R² ≈ 0.36); higher horsepower tends to correspond to higher price.
💼 My Role & Contributions

Conducted data cleaning and descriptive analysis, detecting outliers and verifying assumptions.

Performed hypothesis testing and regression modeling, ensuring calculation accuracy and documentation consistency.

Created visual summaries (box plots, bar charts, scatter plots) for presentation and interpretation.

Coordinated the final report writing, ensuring statistical conclusions were expressed in clear, non-technical terms.

🧠 Lessons Learned

Understood how hypothesis testing clarifies patterns that appear significant but may arise by chance.

Learned to combine descriptive, inferential, and visualization approaches for balanced analysis.

Strengthened collaboration and version control skills—using consistent file naming, tabulation templates, and audit notes.

Recognized that data management and transparency are as critical as computation in producing credible results.

“Statistics is not only about numbers—it is about structuring uncertainty into knowledge.”
