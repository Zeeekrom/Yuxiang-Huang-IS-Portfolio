## 🎯 Overview

This project applies **descriptive** and **inferential statistical methods** to analyze relationships within the *Cars* dataset.  
Working as a mock analytics team for an automotive industry magazine, our objective was to provide **data-driven insights** about car performance and pricing trends using real-world datasets.

The analysis focused on three core statistical questions:

1. Is there a difference in mean horsepower between US and non-US midsize cars?  
2. Is car type associated with price category?  
3. Is there a relationship between horsepower and price among expensive cars?

## 🧩 Methods & Techniques

- **Descriptive Analysis:** mean, standard deviation, quartiles, fences, box plots.  
- **Inferential Analysis:**  
  - Two-sample *t*-test (Welch) for comparing means.  
  - Chi-square test for association between categorical variables.  
  - Simple linear regression for modeling horsepower–price relationship.  
- **Tools Used:** Excel statistical functions, charts, and built-in analysis add-ins.  
- **Significance Level:** α = 0.05; both classical and p-value approaches applied.

## 📈 Key Findings

| **Question**                      | **Method**          | **Main Finding**                                             |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Mean Horsepower (US vs. Non-US) | Two-Sample *t*-Test | Non-US midsize cars have slightly higher mean horsepower, but the difference is **not statistically significant**. |
| 2️⃣ Car Type vs. Price Category     | Chi-Square Test     | **No significant association** found — price level is not strongly dependent on car type alone. |
| 3️⃣ Horsepower vs. Price            | Linear Regression   | **Positive and significant relationship** (*p* < 0.05, R² ≈ 0.36); higher horsepower tends to correspond to higher price. |

## 💼 My Role & Contributions

- Conducted **data cleaning** and descriptive analysis, detecting outliers and verifying assumptions.  
- Performed **hypothesis testing** and **regression modeling**, ensuring accuracy and proper documentation.  
- Created **visual summaries** (box plots, bar charts, scatter plots) for presentation and interpretation.  
- Coordinated **final report writing**, ensuring that results were explained in clear, non-technical language.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Understood how **hypothesis testing** clarifies patterns that appear significant but may arise by chance.  
- Learned to **combine descriptive, inferential, and visualization methods** for balanced analysis.  
- Strengthened **collaboration and version control**, using consistent file naming and tabulation templates.  
- Realized that **data management and transparency** are as critical as computation for credible results.
