👋 About Me

I am a software engineering student specializing in information systems, data governance, and AI-driven project management.
My academic and industry experience bridges structured management frameworks (PMBOK, Agile) with system design and data analytics.
I enjoy transforming complex workflows into measurable, well-documented solutions that connect technology with business strategy.

🧭 Overview

This portfolio presents selected academic and professional projects that demonstrate my ability to design, manage, and optimize information systems.
Each project reflects my interest in connecting data architecture, management strategy, and cross-functional collaboration.

Each project folder includes a concise README and selected materials such as figures, analysis reports, or system diagrams.
