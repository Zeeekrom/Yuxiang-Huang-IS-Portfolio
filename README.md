  ## 👋 About Me  

  I am a software engineering student specializing in **information systems**, **data governance**, and **AI-driven project management**.  
  My academic and industry experience bridges creative production, data analytics, and system design — connecting how information is **collected, organized, and transformed into actionable decisions**.  

  Through research, coursework, and internships at Tencent, Lilith Games, and Perfect World, I have explored how large-scale organizations manage complex data flows, balance human collaboration with automation, and ensure reliability through information governance.  

  This portfolio presents the systems, workflows, and analytical frameworks I built or studied across different domains — from multi-agent simulations and AIGC pipelines to academic research and enterprise data processes.

  ## 🎯 Purpose  

  This repository showcases my progression from **creative execution** to **system-level thinking** —  
  how information is **structured, stored, transferred, and reused** across different domains.  

  **Core Themes:**  

  - 🧩 **Information Architecture** – Designing schemas, metadata, and traceable records.  
  - 🗂️ **Data Governance** – Building processes that ensure accuracy, lineage, and compliance.  
  - 📊 **Decision Support Systems** – Turning logs, analytics, and dashboards into actionable insights.  
  - 🔄 **Cross-Domain Integration** – Bridging creative, academic, and technical workflows under consistent frameworks.
